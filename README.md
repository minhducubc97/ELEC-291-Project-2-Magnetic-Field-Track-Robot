# ELEC-291-Project-2-Magnetic-Field-Track-Robot
Second project

For the second project of ELEC291/ELEC292, I have to design, build, program, and test a
controlled autonomous robot using the magnetic field generated by a guide wire.

I used Atmega328P-AVR microcontroller to output the appropriate voltage pulses that generate magnetic field along the guided wire. On the robot, I used C8051F38C microcontroller to control the robot's wheels (move forward, rotate 180 degrees, turn left, turn right) and detect the magnetic field to adjust the movement correspondingly.

Below is the picture of the robot:
