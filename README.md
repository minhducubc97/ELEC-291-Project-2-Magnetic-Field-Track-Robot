# ELEC-291-Project-2-Magnetic-Field-Track-Robot
Second project

For the second project of ELEC291/ELEC292, I have to design, build, program, and test a
controlled autonomous robot using the magnetic field generated by a guide wire.

I used C8051F38C microcontroller to output the appropriate voltage pulses that generate magnetic field along the guided wire. On the robot, I used Atmega328P microcontroller to control the robot's wheels (move forward, rotate 180 degrees, turn left, turn right) and detect the magnetic field to adjust the movement correspondingly.
